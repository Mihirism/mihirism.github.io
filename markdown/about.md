## Who we are

learnlabs family is the  growing community of seekers and self designed learners who have come together to unfold the paths of learning societies by challenging the ready made institutional way of learning and living.

## Vision

To reclaim the meaning of education and breaking the existing factory-model of learning we are committed to creating spaces and processes where individual and communities can together engage in creative learning.

## Current Mission

To help communities and individuals to create their own informal learning commons like home schooling/unshooling groups, Gap year/Walkouts networks, self designed learning webs, Maker/Hacker/ learning spaces.

## Philosophy

Today factory schooling and literacy programs are suppressing many diverse forms of human learning and expression, as well as much needed organic processes towards just and harmonious social regeneration. So we believe that communities should come togather to reclaim the control over their own learning processes and learning ecologies.
