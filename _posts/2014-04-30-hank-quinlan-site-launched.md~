Well. Finally got new website and blog.It taks just 15 min to set up whole thing.Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. My friend and team mate Lakhan helped me lot to make it live-- Thanks lakhan. Now I will use this platform to publish reports about my day to day work, share my views on different topics, and also to plan my day.
