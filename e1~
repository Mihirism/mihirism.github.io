Essay 1.1- “Is the world getting better or worse”

My first question is 'what is THE WORLD ?' in my mind there are different types of world. 1. world between you and other person 2. world between you and small group 3. world between you and your community 4. world between you and nature.Every single thing will impact differently in low and high with every type of world. 

Now let's talk about What is Better and Worse ? for every person in the world it mean very differently and dynamically. Because every person is different. so some things are good for me and the same things are not good for other person. some way of life is only good for me and the same way is not good for other person.

so what exactly 'Better'
